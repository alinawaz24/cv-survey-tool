        <h1>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET</h1>
        <h2>Research Project: Interview Screening Assistant</h2>
        <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Ali Nawaz<br>
        <strong>Department:</strong> Computer Science<br>
        <strong>University of Sheffield</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Invitation to Participate</h3>
        <p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully. Take time to decide whether you wish to take part.</p>
        
        <h3>What is the purpose of this project?</h3>
        <p>This research aims to compare how humans evaluate job candidates based on CVs against automated assessment software. The study seeks to understand the similarities and differences between human judgment and algorithmic assessment in the recruitment process. This research is being conducted as part of the dissertation in Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science at the University of Sheffield.</p>
        
        <h3>Why have I been chosen?</h3>
        <p>You have been invited to participate as a member of the university community. We are recruiting approximately 20 participants from various academic backgrounds, including both students and staff, to represent evaluators with different levels of experience in candidate assessment.</p>
        
        <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
        <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and asked to sign a consent form. You are free to withdraw at any time before submitting your final evaluations, without giving a reason and with no negative consequences. If you wish to withdraw from the research, please contact the researcher using the details provided below.</p>
        <p>Taking part in this research is voluntary and will not create a legally binding agreement or any form of employment with the University of Sheffield.</p>
        
        <h3>What will happen if I take part?</h3>
        <p>If you decide to participate, you will be asked to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review a job description for a specific professional role</li>
            <li>Evaluate 5 anonymized CVs against this job description</li>
            <li>Rate each CV using a standardized scoring form</li>
            <li>Rank the CVs in order of preference for the position</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The entire process will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>
        
        <h3>What are the possible disadvantages of taking part?</h3>
        <p>There are no significant risks or disadvantages associated with participating in this study. The task involves only reading and evaluating documents, which is a routine cognitive activity similar to what you might do in academic or professional settings.</p>
        
        <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
        <p>While there are no immediate personal benefits from participating in this research, your contribution will help advance my understanding of recruitment processes and may inform the development of fairer and more efficient hiring practices in the future.</p>
        
        <h3>Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?</h3>
        <p>All your personal data will be kept strictly confidential and will only be accessible to members of the research team. Your evaluations will be anonymized during data analysis, and you will not be identifiable in any reports or publications resulting from this research.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>The data collected during this research will be stored securely on password-protected university systems. Only the research team will have access to your identifiable personal information. This identifiable information will be deleted once data collection is complete, while the anonymized evaluation data will be retained for analysis.</p>
        <p>This research is carried out 'in the public interest' in accordance with data protection legislation. Further information can be found in the University's Privacy Notice: <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/govern/data-protection/privacy/general" target="_blank">https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/govern/data-protection/privacy/general</a>.</p>
        <p>The University of Sheffield will act as the Data Controller for this study. This means that the University is responsible for looking after your information and using it properly.</p>
        
        <h3>What will happen to the results of the research?</h3>
        <p>The results of this research will be included in my dissertation project. A summary of the findings can be made available to you upon request. You will not be identified in any report or publication.</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of this research, others may find the data collected useful in answering future research questions. I will ask for your explicit consent for your anonymized data to be shared for future research purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>Who has ethically reviewed the project?</h3>
        <p>This project has been approved by the ethics committee at the University of Sheffield.</p>
        
        <h3>What if something goes wrong and I wish to complain?</h3>
